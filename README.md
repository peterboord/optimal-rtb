Optimal Real-Time Bidding for Display Advertising
===========

This repository contains two machine learning analyses of Real-Time Bidding (RTB) data from the iPinYou dataset.
The analyses are done in Jupyter Notebooks, found in the Python directory. One notebook analyzes the data using Logistic Rgeression. The other notebook analyzes the data using a Neural Network.

The repository is built from a fork of another repository ((https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data) that formalises the iPinYou RTB data into a standard format.
